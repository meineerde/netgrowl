= netgrowl

Send Growl notifications by UDP in pure Ruby.

== Examples

  ##
  # Register an application
  # This has to be done once per client. But *not* once per session.
  # Registering an application will reset all settings on the client.

  Growl.register("All messages", :application => "My Application")

  # OR

  # Register two identifiers. But only the first is enabled by default here.
  Growl.register [
    "Important Stuff",
    {:identifier => "Debug", :enable => false}
  ], :application => "My Application"


  ##
  # Send a notification

  Growl.notify {
    application = "My Application"
    identifier = "All messages"

    title = "Important!"
    message = 'Hello World'
    sticky!
  }

  # OR

  include Growl
  notify "Hello there", :application => "My Application"

  # OR

  Growl.notify "Hello!", :application => "My Application", :sticky => true
